Atto editor embedquestion plugin

To enable the embedquestion Atto editor plugin button to show please use this setup:

System admin > Plugins > Text editors > Atto HTML editor > Atto toolbar settings
Toolbar config (editor_atto|toolbar) Add 'embedquestion' to an appropriate place in the config setting, then save.

Assuming you are logged in with a role that has the capability 'moodle/question:useall' on the course context
then the button will be displayed whenever the Atto toolbar is displayed.
